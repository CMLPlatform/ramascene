Industry value added is industry’s contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Total value added is total GDP. <h5>Employment (Unit 1000p)</h5> People occupied in paid work. <h5>Employment hours (Unit M.Hr)</h5> People occupied in paid work.<br> <h5>GHG emissions</h5> GHG emissions: Total, PFC and HFC are characterised to GWP100 (Unit kg CO2-eq) others indicators are not characterised (Unit kg)<h5>Domestic Extraction Used (Unit kt)	</h5><i>The annual flows of raw materials extracted or harvested from the environment and that physically enter the economic system for further processing or direct consumption (they are used by the economy as material factor inputs) </i>(EUROSTAT) <h5>Domestic Extraction Used - Metal Ores (Unit kt)</h5> <i>Metal ores are mineral aggregates containing metals. Most metal ores are polymetallic, i.e. the metal ore contains more than one metal. The different metals are separated during the production process.[...] Metals are essential for a wide range of industries like mechanical engineering, transport, aerospace, construction, packaging, electricity and energy, consumer electronics, medical devices, etc.</i>(EUROSTAT) <h5>Domestic Extraction Used - Non-Metallic Minerals (Unit kt)</h5> <i> Minerals are essential raw materials for modern society, contributing significantly to its social and technological progress. They are used for the production of infrastructure such as roads, homes, schools and hospitals, and in many industrial and consumer products such as cars, computers, medicines, and household appliances.</i>(EUROSTAT) <h5>Vulnerable employment (Unit 1000p)</h5><i> Own-account workers and contributing family workers have a likelihood of having [in]formal work arrangements, and are therefore more likely to lack elements associated with decent employment, such as adequate social security and a voice at work. Therefore, the two statuses are summed to create a classification of ‘vulnerable employment’, while wage and salaried workers together with employers constitute ‘non-vulnerable employment’. </i> (ILO)";
